DESC Kirnberger Ⅲ

! Start C-E as pure major third, then pure fifths up to F♯ and down to D♭
! Cₙ-Eₙ₊₂ is the definition of the syntonic comma, divide it on four fifths
! The schisma sits between F♯ and C♯ to close the circle.

A♭ = D♭
E♭ = A♭
B♭ = E♭
F  = B♭
C  = F
G  = C - 1/4 S
D  = G - 1/4 S
A  = D - 1/4 S
E  = A - 1/4 S
B  = E
F♯ = B

VALIDATE

E  = C		! same as
E  = C * 5 / 4

C♯ = F♯ - D
C♯ = F♯ * 4/3 - D ! same thing, expressed as (missorted) tempered fourth

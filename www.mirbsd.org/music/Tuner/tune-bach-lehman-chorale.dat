DESC Bach/Lehman Chorale
! (transposed from Bach/Lehman 1722)
! (This can also be achieved by using the option -T C:D together
! with the tune-bach-lehman-1722.dat file.)

! Rules are the same except D is played as if it were a C, etc.
! (one tone up), because of the Chorton/Cammerton issues in which
! pieces once were composed, e.g., for C Major on an instrument
! that sounded two semitones higher than the rest; in modern
! scores, these have been transposed to e.g. D Major (two ♯ more)

D  = G - 1/6 P
A  = D - 1/6 P
E  = A - 1/6 P
B  = E - 1/6 P
F♯ = B - 1/6 P
C♯ = F♯
G♯ = C♯
D♯ = G♯
B♭ = E♭ - 1/12 P
F  = B♭ - 1/12 P
C  = F  - 1/12 P

VALIDATE

G  = C  + 1/12 P

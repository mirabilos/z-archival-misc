! Each fifth is tempered ¼ comma (ca. 5½ ¢) so that major thirds are pure,
! but resulting in a 36½¢ “wolf” between E♭ and A♭/G♯

B♭ = E♭ - 1/4 S
F  = B♭ - 1/4 S
C  = F  - 1/4 S
G  = C  - 1/4 S
D  = G  - 1/4 S
A  = D  - 1/4 S
E  = A  - 1/4 S
B  = E  - 1/4 S
F♯ = B  - 1/4 S
C♯ = F♯ - 1/4 S
G♯ = C♯ - 1/4 S

! TODO: check against known cent values (for const C)
! XXX same as tune-mean4th in this form, perhaps wrong (P not S)?

<h3 class="content-subhead">MuseScore Workshop</h3>
<p>The workshop will introduce you to working with MuseScore,
 i.e. have a practical part. For this, you’re invited to bring
 your own laptop <strong>with MuseScore 2.x pre-installed</strong>.
 (Do not install version 3.x which is still alpha. Version 1.x
 looks different and lacks many features, so please look for a
 2.x release.) It may be possible to borrow a laptop on-site.</p>
<h4>Linux users</h4>
<p>Debian stable and oldstable users please <a
 href="https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/#index2h2">enable
 Debian backports</a> (backports-sloppy for oldstable) and then
 install MuseScore with:</p><ul>
 <li><tt>apt-get -t jessie-backports-sloppy install musescore</tt> # oldstable</li>
 <li><tt>apt-get -t stretch-backports install musescore</tt> # stable</li>
 <li><tt>apt-get install musescore</tt> # testing or unstable</li>
</ul>
<p>Ubuntu and Linux Mint users can use <a
 href="https://launchpad.net/~mscore-ubuntu/+archive/ubuntu/mscore-stable">the
 official PPA</a> to get the latest MuseScore version (<a
 href="https://musescore.org/en/musescore-2-ubuntu-14.04-and-above">instructions</a>).</p>
<p>Debian stable and Ubuntu 16.04 already contain a MuseScore 2.0 package,
 Ubuntu 18.04 contains MuseScore 2.1; while these are older than the
 current MuseScore 2.3.2 they will suffice for the workshop.</p>
<h4>Mac, Windows, other Linux distros</h4>
<p>Users of other operating systems please look at the official <a
 href="https://musescore.org/en/download">MuseScore downloads</a> page.</p>
<h4>Workshop notes</h4>
<p>Workshop participants could bring MIDI input devices of their own for
 note input, but space is tight, so perhaps it’s better to keep them home.
 Also, please understand that they should be completely set up <em>before</em>
 the workshop, in order to not cut into the workshop time. Time’s also tight
 so I may not be able to talk about them much.</p>
<p>It’s advisable to also bring headphones. Many people in a room toying with
 sound output at the same time is bound to be slightly cacophonic.</p>
<p>To save time and follow more easily it’d be good to have the font <a
 href="http://www.mirbsd.org/music/free/resources/Gentium-1.03.zip">Gentium</a>
 installed and the <tt>*.mscx</tt> and <tt>*.mid</tt> files from the <a
 href="https://edugit.org/mirabilos/mscore-workshop/tree/master/samples">samples
 for the workshop</a> downloaded and handy.</p>

# [mirabilos’ MuseScore workshop](https://mirabilos.edugit.org/mscore-workshop/)

This is mirabilos’ repository with material for holding a
[MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) workshop — first at
[Sonoj Convention](https://sonoj.org/) 2018.

There are notes, such as a [link list](https://mirabilos.edugit.org/mscore-workshop/notes/linklist.htm),
and slides in MagicPoint format (for a 1024x768-resolution laptop),
also web-browsable as [HTML-exported slides](https://mirabilos.edugit.org/mscore-workshop/html/index.html).
A number of [samples](samples/) I used during the workshop are also available.

Contributions welcome! Just drop me an eMail — for example
at ＜ｍｉｒａｂｉｌｏｓ＠ｅｖｏｌｖｉｓ．ｏｒｇ＞ — or
catch me in Freenode IRC!

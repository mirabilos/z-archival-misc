This is Lunix Ewe, an embedded Java™ virtual machine derived
from Ewesoft Linux® Ewe: http://www.ewesoft.com/M2.htm

The original Ewe and Waba VM and class library are under the
GNU LGPL v2.1 – mircvs://src/share/doc/legal/COPYING.LIB-2_1
contains the full text – with an exception that linking with
the library (or VM) does not constitute creating a derivate.
The files mpixbuf.{c,h} from the VM, which glue to GTK+, are
exempt from this exception, they are purely LGPLv2 or later.
Some files originate from GNU Classpath and are covered by a
GNU GPLv2 or later with library exception clause instead.

The javadoc generated API documentation is a derived work of
the class library and thusly licenced under the same terms.

The examples are provided with the Ewe SDK and assumed to be
freely redistributable under the same terms. The Jewel buil-
der, which comes without source, is assumed propagatable, in
an unmodified version at least. The various graphics, icons,
the Locale.dat file, and non-autogenerated documentation are
also assumed freely redistributable without modification but
an inquiry about their licencing status has been sent to the
Ewesoft company’s owner. Same for the few binary files with-
out source: stuff in extrajar/ and EweConfig.ewe.

Source code for ewex_registry.dll has been bundled under the
same licence terms as the VM itself (LGPLv2.1). We could not
yet obtain source code of java_ewe.dll but assume it’s built
from the Win32 VM sources (under LGPLv2.1).

The files CompileEwe.{tgz,zip}, JavaEwe.{tgz,zip}, ewe.{ewe,
jar,jar.tgz} are bundled in CVS but, in fact, generated from
the classes/ and extrajar/ source code and the imagery, plus
the binary files from extrajar/ for ewe.jar{,.tgz} only. The
compiled sample files are generated from the bundled source.

Lunix Ewe (this fork), maintained in the MirOS Project’s CVS
repository, is, additionally, Copyright © 2007, 2008
	Thorsten “mirabilos” Glaser <tg@mirbsd.de>
All changes are also provided under a standard MirOS Licence
without advertising clause. This licencing model is compati-
ble to the GNU Amended LGPLv2.1 or GPLv2 with library excep-
tion clause, as required.

This fork has been created to bypass the time until the next
generation of embedded VMs, namely Eve, is ready to use, and
is not intended to infringe Ewesoft or their products in any
way whatsoever. It’s a fun project, done to improve portabi-
lity of CacheWolf and fix some bugs. We would be glad if our
changes could be merged back into the main project.

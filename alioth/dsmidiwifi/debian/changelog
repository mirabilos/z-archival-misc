dsmidiwifi (2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial packaging, based on latest (post-1.01) upstream trunk,
    as Debian native package, as upstream went away (Closes: #869749)
  * Fix some bugs, mostly in error handling
  * Implement Aâ‚„ mapping to different MIDI notes, to work around
    some DSMI-capable applications not using the 69 standard value

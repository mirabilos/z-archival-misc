# The mirabilos-support package already ensures gnupg (version 1.x)
# stays installed; here’s how (on stretch/sid) to make $(gpg) return
# to that while keeping $(gpg2) as GnuPG 2.x which even its developers
# agree is no drop-in replacement for GnuPG 1.x:

 sudo sh -exc '
	case $(GNUPGHOME=/nonexistent gpg --version 2>/dev/null | head -1) in
	(gpg\ \(GnuPG\)\ 2.*)
		dpkg-divert --local --rename --divert /usr/bin/gpg2.distrib \
		    --add /usr/bin/gpg
		;;
	esac
	test -x /usr/bin/gpg2.distrib && ln -sfT gpg2.distrib /usr/bin/gpg2
	test -x /usr/bin/gpg1 && ln -sfT gpg1 /usr/bin/gpg
 '

# Run this after every system upgrade because otherwise, “gpg2” will
# also call gnupg 1.x when one of them is upgraded.

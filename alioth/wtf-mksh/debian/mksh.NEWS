mksh (56-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The new /etc/skel/.mkshrc moves selection of the default EDITOR
  (for when the parameter was not set prior to running it) to near
  the top, before /etc/mkshrc runs. It contains a user-editable
  priority list (first match wins) and, newly, defaults to Debian’s
  sensible-editor (after a previously-set $EDITOR, of course). It
  is therefore recommended to update from the skeleton file.

mksh (55-1) experimental; urgency=low

  User-visible changes to the shell language (R55):
  - The POSIX declaration utility concept is introduced, which also
    applies to commands having variable assignments and redirections
    preceding them. "wait" however does not keep assignments any longer.
  - The new "\builtin" utility forwards the declaration utility flag
    exactly like "command" does.
  - The new "typeset -g" replaces mksh’s previous home-grown "global"
    builtin, which is now deprecated and *will* be removed from a future
    version.
  - Aliases are now expanded for command, function and value substitutions
    at parse time (like for functions, and excepting ‘`’-style ones).
  - "typeset -f" output is now alias-resistent and thus more reentrant.
  - Alias names are now limited to [A-Za-z0-9_!%,@], following POSIX,
    although a non-leading hyphen-minus is also permitted.
  - "print -R" is now (correctly) roughly equivalent to POSIX mode echo.
  - The "let]" hack is gone.
  - "ulimit -a" output changed to display the associated flag.
  - $PATHSEP is now pre-defined to ‘:’ (‘;’ on OS/2).

  The delta between mksh and lksh and the deltas between normal, posix
  and “sh” mode are now properly documented in the manual pages; see
  README.Debian for which options are enabled in which Debian binaries.

mksh (53-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  User-visible changes to the shell language (R53):
  - Tilde expansion for HOME/PWD/OLDPWD now simplifies the PATH
  - Rotation operators were renamed from <<< and >>> to ^< and ^>
  - File descriptors are, once again, sole digits

  These are in preparation for changes planned in R54:
  - Perl-ish named file descriptors (ksh93-style) are being researched

mksh (52c-2exp2) experimental; urgency=low

  The musl C library is now used for /bin/mksh-static and /bin/lksh
  as another, i.e. third, alternative, on architectures that have it.

 -- Thorsten Glaser <tg@mirbsd.de>  Thu, 14 Apr 2016 19:04:08 +0200

mksh (52c-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The /bin/mksh-static binary may now be a symbolic link to
  a binary placed under /usr – take suitable action if this
  is a problem for you. In Debian, /bin/mksh should suffice
  as rescue shell as glibc lives in /lib; for e.g. an initrd,
  copy the binary straight from the klibc or dietlibc (your
  choice) bin directory instead. Note that either is only
  populated if the relevant build succeeded.

mksh (52a.wtf1) wtf; urgency=medium

  mksh-static comes, again, without a printf builtin, to match sid.

  The issues mentioned in the NEWS entry for 51a.wtf1 remain.

mksh (51a.wtf1) wtf; urgency=high

  The /bin/mksh-static binary includes printf as builtin again
  now that the shell prefers an external utility if found.

  This is a feature release introducing several user-visible
  changes; see the changelog for more information.

  Known issues in this release to be fixed in R52:
  - x=<< feature cannot be used in functions and leaks memory
  - startup fails if COLUMNS, LINENO in the environment and invalid
  - nested ADELIM expansions (${x:1:2}, ${x/y/z}) buffer-overflow
  - ${x/y/z} and related expansions don’t tilde-expand
  These are all no regressions but have existed for a while.

mksh (50f-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The pdksh transitional package is gone after two full
  releases – pdksh was last in oldoldoldstable.

  The /bin/mksh binary no longer inspects argv[0] to enable
  POSIX and kludge modes when called as sh; use mksh-static
  (as sh and user shell for initrd) or lksh (as /bin/sh on
  general systems) instead.

mksh (50j20150411wtf1) unstable; urgency=high

  The /bin/mksh binary no longer inspects argv[0] to enable
  POSIX and kludge modes when called as sh; use mksh-static
  (as sh and user shell for initrd) or lksh (as /bin/sh on
  general systems) instead.

  In mksh (and mksh-static), ksh-style functions (defined with
  the “function” keyword instead of parenthesēs) have local
  scope for shell options (“set -o”) now.

mksh (50j20150320wtf1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The kludge that defining a POSIX-style function undefines
  an alias with the same name has been moved to lksh. So, if
  you define a shell function with the same name as a built-in
  or otherwise already defined alias, e.g. “stop”, be prepared
  for mayhem. (Actually, just invoke the function as “\stop”,
  or use the “unalias” facility.)

  This version adds a GNU bash-like “enable” implementation
  to the stock mkshrc file. It works by setting magic aliases
  that call an external utility with the same name (e.g. use
  “enable -n rename” to use the Perl-based /usr/bin/rename),
  which means it takes precedence over shell functions, unlike
  in GNU bash. Since shell functions already take precedence
  over shell builtins (there is even one overriding “cd” in
  the stock mkshrc file), just don’t use “enable -n” for them.

  The pdksh transitional package is gone after two full

mksh (50-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The right-hand side of “nameref” (typeset -n) expressions
  is now checked for validity. (Although, this is only fixed
  for positional parameters and other special variables in
  mksh 50b-1.)

  The “arr=([index]=value)” syntax is gone because of severe
  bugs in its implementation and regressions in other places.
  It will eventually be brought back, but not right now. Use
  of “set -A arr -- [index]=value” has not been historically
  supported by ksh and will not be brought back in mksh either.

mksh (46-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The mksh and mksh-static binaries no longer come with the
  limited printf(1) builtin which was only added to please
  a maintainer who likes to use printf while not having
  /usr/bin in their script PATH. It was added to lksh, which
  uses more POSIX-like arithmetics but lacks interactive
  command line editing features (dash does so, too).
  For this reason it’s recommended to use lksh instead of
  mksh or mksh-static as /bin/sh (unless you don’t install
  udev) and keep mksh around for interactive tasks (initrd
  should still use mksh-static exclusively and just provide
  printf(1) in /bin instead); lksh is statically linked on
  platforms providing a libc that supports this use case
  well and is not glibc/eglibc.

  $ sudo ln -sf lksh /bin/sh
  is the correct command to use for applying this change.

mksh (40.4-1~bpo50+1) lenny-backports-sloppy; urgency=medium

  The debconf magic for automatically installing /bin/mksh as
  /bin/sh is gone. If you want to do that, set the symlink in
  /bin/sh and /usr/share/man/man1/sh.1.gz yourself, as root.
  Be aware that only the latest mksh versions can safely be
  used as /bin/sh since in the past after many uploads issues
  regarding bugs or assumptuous maintainer or init scripts of
  other packages have been found which need to be addressed
  by updates of the mksh package.

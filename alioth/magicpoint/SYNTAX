%xfont "font"
%xfont "font" "registry"
	<font> :: use X11's <font> to draw characters.
	"font" is for specifying X11 XLFD, font alias name, or
	"family-weight-slant".
	"registry" is for specifying "registry-encoding".

	interpretation of "registry":
	- If none specified, "iso8859-1" is assumed.
	- If no dash inside, encoding of "*" is assumed.
	  Therefore, you'll get "REGISTRY-*".
	- If there's a single dash inside, use specified value.
	  Therefore, you'll get "REGISTRY-SPECIFIED".

	interpretation of "font":
	- If it has no dash inside,
		Try font alias, such as "8x5" or "a14".
		If there's no font alias matched, it should be "times" or
		something like that. In this case, try
		"-*-FONT-*-*-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-REGISTERY-SPECIFIED".
	- If it has single dash inside, such as "times-medium":
		Try "-*-FONT-NAME-*-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-REGISTRY-SPECIFIED".
	- If it has two dash inside, such as "times-medium-r":
		Try "-*-FONT-NAME-SPECIFIED-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-REGISTRY-SPECIFIED".
	- Otherwise, try the specified string itself as XLFD.

	Some exercises:
	%xfont "times"
		You'll get "-*-times-*-*-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1".
	%xfont "mincho" "jisx0208.1983"
		You'll get "-*-mincho-*-*-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-*".
	%xfont "mincho-medium-r" "jisx0208.1983"
		You'll get "-*-mincho-medium-r-*-*-SIZE-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-*".

	NOTE: Only the following items are meaningful as "registry".
		jisx0208.1983-*
		gb2312.1980-*
		ksc5601.1987-*
		iso8859-1
		iso8859-2
		iso8859-3
		iso8859-4
	It would be nice if we can support "adobe-specific" for symbols,
	however, we have no escape sequence to designate the it...


	%xfont will accept Xft2/fontconfig-style
	"FONTNAME", "FONTNAME:STYLE", and "FONTNAME:style=STYLE".
	Note that if you specify "FONTNAME" and it contains '-', it will be
	interpreted as XLFD.  In such a case, you should use "FONTNAME:STYLE"
	or "FONTNAME:style=STYLE".

%psfont "font"
	<font>:: use PostScript fonts to create PostScript file
	Suported fonts are:
			Times-[Roman|Italic|Bold|BoldItalic]
			Helvetica
			Helvetica-[BoldOblique|Bold|Oblique]

	if none of this fonts is specified it uses the default font Helvetica.

%bar <color> <width> <start> <length>
	<color> :: color of bar, foreground color will be used as default.
	<width> :: permill of display height. default 10.
	<start> :: start position percent of display width. default 0.
	<length> :: length percent of display width. default 100.

%valign "top|center|bottom"

%image "imagefile" <numcolor> <xzoomrate> <yzoomrate> <zoomflag>
%image "imagefile" [ [<numcolor>] <screensize> ]
	"imagefile" :: name of image file
	<numcolor> :: number of colors, 0 means no reduction.
	<xzoomrate> :: height percentage against physical display or original
			size, 0 means the original height.
	<yzoomrate> :: width percentage against physical display or original
			size, 0 means the original width.
	<zoomflag> :: 0 means zoomrate is against physial display
			others mean zoomrate is against original size

	<screensize> :: auto resizing.
			specify the original screen size by WIDTHxHEIGHT.
			unless screensize is the same size of the physical
			display, zoomrate is calculated automagically.

	Note that if the image is a binary image, current foreground
	and background colors are applied to the drawn image.

%newimage [options] "imagefile"

	Same as %image, but it is much easier to understand.
	options include:
	    -colors numcolors
	    -xysize pixel pixel
	    -zoom percentage
	    -xyzoom x-percentage y-percentage
		Percentage is against the original image.
		"100" means the original image size, "50" means
		half the original image size.
	    -scrzoom percentage
	    -xscrzoom percentage
	    -yscrzoom percentage
	    -xyscrzoom x-percentage y-percentage
		Percentage is against the screen. "100" means screen
		width/height, "50" means half the screen width/height.
		-xscrzoom and -yscrzoom scales image with aspect
		ratio unchanged.
        -raise percentage
		raise the baseline of the image in the line.
		Percentage is against the height of the image.
		"100" means the height of the image.
        -rotate degrees
		degrees is angle measure counter clockwise, supported values are
		0, -90, 90, -180, 180, 270
		-zoomonclk percentage
		enlarge image when it is clicked. Percentage is against the screen.
		"100" means screen width.


	TODO: supersede %image by %newimage?
	TODO: option for auto resize mode (fit image into the room left on
		the screen)

%prefix "string"
	Place "string" at the beginning of line.
	"string" should be a set of blank characters (\040).

	The effect of %prefix command in %tab command is local to
	tab-indented line.

%prefix <percentage>
	specify prefix spacing by <percentage> of the drawing area width.

	The effect of %prefix command in %tab command is local to
	tab-indented line.

%icon <arc|box|delta1|delta2|delta3|delta4|dia> <color> <size>
%icon <imagefile> <color> <size>
	add an icon for itemizing lines.
	for example,
		%tab 1 size 5, icon box green 50
	gives you an green box on the leftmost column of line.
	size is the percentage against the current character size.

%bimage "imagefile" [ <screensize> ]
	Specify the name of background image file
	<screensize> :: auto resizing.
			specify the original screen size by WIDTHxHEIGHT.
			unless screensize is the same size of the physical
			display, zoomrate is calculated automagically.

%default <linenum> <list-of-directives>
	Unless nodefault directive is specified, the directives in the
	argument is prepended to the directives of the linenum'th line
	in every page. The syntax of <list-of-directives> is a comma
	separated directives.
	This directive has to be placed in the preamble.

%tab <tabnum> <list-of-directives>
	Apply list of directives, if any of the lines start with tabnum
	tabs.
	This directive has to be placed in the preamble.

%tab <id> <list-of-directives>
	Apply list of directives, if any of the lines start with "&id".
	This directive has to be placed in the preamble.

%page
	A new page starts

%vgap <gapsize>
	Specify vertical gap size of each line
	<gapsize>:: percentage against current character size
		vertical gap = vertical font size * gapsize / 100

%hgap <gapsize>
	Specify horizontal gap size of each line
	<gapsize>:: percentage against current character size
		horizontal gap = vertical font size * gapsize / 100
	NOTE: horizontal gap is calculated based on vertical size,
	because fonts are proportional (horizontal size varies by code point).

%pause
	Stop drawing until forward key or button is pressed

%mark
	Mark the current position on the screen, so that we can come back
	later by %again.
	NOTE: mark is local to a page.  mark will be cleared at the page
	boundary.

%again
	Move current position to the location marked by %mark.

%system "command"
	Fork&exec the specified program.
	NOTE: the program will be invoked every time the page is redrawn.
	It sometimes annoy you.  it needs some rework.

	Special translation for presentation-window-relative geometry:
		Argument that starts with "%" will be translated as if
		it was interpreted relative to presentation window.

		"xeyes -geometry %50x50+25+25"  will be translated
		so that eyes appear on the center of the presentation window.

	The command has to be placed on a line alone.
	Do not use commas.

	Process will be killed when you leave the page.

%system "command" <page>
	Almost same as above.
	Process will be killed when you leave the specified <page>.
	If you set <page> to -1, the process will be killed when MagicPoint
	is terminated. (of course, you can terminate the child process alone
	by yourself)

%filter "command"
TEXT
%endfilter
	Fork&exec the specified program, feed TEXT into that process
	from standard input.  use the standard output from the process
	as presentation input.
	Do not forget to place %endfilter.

	The command has to be placed on a line alone.
	Do not use commas.

%deffont "fontname" <list-of-directives>
	Define a symbolic fontname, by using list-of-directives.
	The directive must appear in the preamble.

	For example, you may want to define a serif font as:
	%deffont "standard" xfont "Gentium:style=Italic", xfont "Gentium Italic"
	By using the above definition, you can make your presentation file
	less dependent to the configuration of magicpoint binary.

	"%font" cannot be used in "%deffont".  this is for avoiding infinite
	loops.

%font "fontname"
	Invoke the symbolic fontname defined by %deffont directive.

%noop
	No operation

%pcache <flag> <mode> <effect> <value>
	<flag> :: enable or disable forward page cache

		iso8859-1
		iso8859-2
		iso8859-3
		iso8859-4

%area <width> <height> [<xoffset> <yoffset>]
	Specify the drawing area within the window.  All parameters are
	translated as relative value of the window.  If offset is not
	specified, the drawing area will be put center.
	Note that all relative size specified in other directive after
	"%area" will be affected, i.e. it will be relative to the
	width/height of the drawing area instead of the window.

%opaque <value>
	<value> :: transparency of the font. (0-100)
	Value 0 means that the font will be drawn with full tranparency.

%setsup <sup offset> <sub offset> <scale>
	Initialize values for subsequent %sup (superscript) and
	%sub (subscript) commands.
	<sup offset> :: set superscript offset (percentage of font size)
	<sub offset> :: set superscript offset (percentage of font size)
	<scale> :: scale factor for super-/subscript font size
	The range of all three integer values goes from 10 to 100.
	When unset, the default value %setsup 40 15 60 is used.

%sup
	Writes the immediately following line as superscript.
	Only works in connection with %cont.

%sub
	Writes the immediately following line as subscript.
	Only works in connection with %cont.

.Nm tex2eps
.Nd MagicPoint filter for embedded formulae
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm eqn2eps ,
.Nm latex2eps
and
.Nm tex2eps
are MagicPoint filters to allow embedding eqn or TeX/LaTeX formulae
into MagicPoint presentations.
Only
.Nm latex2eps
takes an option,
.Fl sty ,
whose option argument is taken as additional LaTeX packages to include.
This option can be passed multiple times to add more than one package.
The mandatory parameter
.Ar obn
is the basename of the output file to generate, without the file extension
.Li \&.eps
which is added automatically.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal
%filter "eqn2eps.sh eqn1"
1 over sqrt {ax sup 2+bx+c}
%endfilter
%center, image "eqn1.eps" 0 400 400 1

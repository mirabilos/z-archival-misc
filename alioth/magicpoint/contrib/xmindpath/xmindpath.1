.Sh NAME
.Nm xmindpath
.Nd MindPath PocketPoint user-level driver for X11
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dv
.Op Fl f Ar dev
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads the signal sent from MindPath PocketPoint device via serial port
and translates that into X11 events.
.Pp
PocketPoint is a laser pointer, with three remote control keys.
Three keys are right arrow, left arrow and
.Dq f/x
key.
Keypress will be transmitted as 1200bps IrDA signal,
which can be parsed by your computer.
.Nm
parses the IrDA input signal, and maps the keypress as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It right arrow
Mouse button 1 (leftmost mouse button).
This key will be interpreted by
.Xr mgp 1
as
.Dq proceed page
request.
.It left arrow
Mouse button 3 (rightmost mouse button).
This key will be interpreted by
.Xr mgp 1
as
.Dq go back one page
request.
.It Do f/x Dc key
Currently mouse button 2 (middle mouse button) is mapped to this key.
However, this will be changed in the near future.
.El
.Pp
To perform remote-controlled presentation,
invoke
.Nm
simultaneously with
.Xr mgp 1
.Po
maybe from a different terminal window
.Pc .
.Pp
If you specify
.Ar dev
after
.Fl f ,
the specified device will be used as serial port.
With
.Fl v ,
.Nm
will generate more messages.
.Fl d
option is provided just for debugging sessions.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Ex -std

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command was implemented by
.An Jun-ichiro Itoh Aq itojun@itojun.org .
.Pp
This program derives most of its X11 related code from twiddler driver.
.Sh BUGS
The keycode for the
.Dq f/x
key should be configurable.
BSDi
.Xr gettyd 8
support would be desirable.

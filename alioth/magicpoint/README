%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

MagicPoint is an X11 based presentation tool.  It is designed to make
simple presentations easy while to make complicated presentations
possible.  Its presentation file (whose suffix is typically .mgp) is
just text so that you can create presentation files quickly with your
favorite editor (e.g. Emacs).

MagicPoint is completely free but absolutely no warranty. For more
information, please refer to LICENCE.

                              INSTALLATION

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You’ll need the following prerequisites to build MagicPoint:

• a POSIX or Korn shell, GNU bash, zsh in “emulate sh” mode;
  some somewhat decent Bourne shell will also do if needed
• a lexical analyser generator (flex)
• a parser generator, usually yacc, but GNU bison will do
• a C compiler, linker, standard c and m library
• make (BSD, GNU or other)
• a way to create static .a archives (ar+ranlib)
• pkg-config
• X11 development headers and libraries (libX11 libXmu libXt libXtst)
• Imlib2
• Xft2
• libbsd, if building on GNU
• optionally, libiconv, libutil

Follow the steps below to make MagicPoint:

	% mkdir obj				# out-of-tree build recommended
	% cd obj
	% sh ../Build.sh			# should be POSIX/Korn shell
	% make -j4				# parallel make supported
	% sudo make install			# DESTDIR supported

By default, this will use the pkg-config files for imlib2, libbsd-overlay,
xft; use the -P flag if you wish to change this.

Note: if you have to use a non-standard compiler, you must declare
      your compiler by using "env" command, like:

	% env CC=gcc sh ../Build.sh		# force gcc
	% env CC=shlicc2 sh ../Build.sh		# force shlicc2 (bsdi3)

Note 2: the configuring process is loud, but as long as Build.sh ends
	with “You can now use make(1) to compile MagicPoint.” it’s ok.
	If your OS was not yet known please report to the developer to
	get it added.

Note 3: if you need to change CC, CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LIBS, …
	pass them to Build.sh in the environment, do *not* override
	them at the make stage; you *can* override SH (sh), AR (ar),
	AR_CREATE (${AR} cq), RANLIB (ranlib), LEX (flex), YACC (yacc)
	if needed for your system and/or cross-compiling.

Note 4: for paths, you can override SYSCONFDIR, PREFIX, BINDIR, … in
	the make run, but keep them consistent between make all and
	make install; also, PERL is used during build for shebang;
	for installing, check INSTALL_STRIP and modes in Makefile.

Note 5: packagers can override mgpversion during build if desired.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It's a good idea to preview sample files before installation. For more
information, see "sample/README" or "sample/README.jp", which
describes how to install TrueType fonts.

To visualise the sample{,-jp}.mgp file, type:

	% ./mgp ../sample/sample.mgp
	% ./mgp ../sample/sample-jp.mgp

To visualise the tutorial{,-jp}.mgp file, type:

	% ./mgp ../sample/tutorial.mgp
	% ./mgp ../sample/tutorial-jp.mgp

WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO BUY TRUETYPE FONTS IF YOU WANT TO GIVE YOUR
PRESENTATION WITH BEAUTIFUL FONTS.

If you want to paste EPS figures into your presentation, you will need
to install "ghostscript" or "alike".

# OS-specific notes:
#
# MidnightBSD: has KERN_ARND, returning only int though;
# looks like this was added independent of FreeBSD. Does
# not have the ioctl but a kern.random.sys.seeded sysctl
# which weâ€™re not touching, for now.
#
# MirBSD: works
#
# NetBSD: needs porting
#
# OpenBSD: needs testing but should work

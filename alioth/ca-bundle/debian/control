Description: ca-certificates and -java replacement (WTF suite, from MirBSD)
 This WTF suite package uses the static MirBSD CA certificate bundle
 to replace both the Debian ca-certificates and ca-certificates-java
 packages public keystores for OpenSSL, GnuTLS, Java™/JKS, Classpath/GCJ,
 as well as Mozilla ckbi source builds. It will also replace KDE 4 and
 J2RE/J2SDK keystore files. This package installs hashed symlinks usable
 with both OpenSSL 1.x and OpenSSL 0.x / GnuTLS into /etc/ssl/certs.
 It also provides an NSS ckbi certdata.txt source file. At least Debian
 jessie (8) is requied; some old replacements were dropped.
 .
 Note that the ksslcalist format used by KDE 3 and KDE 4 is FUBAR BAD,
 as it uses the DN of a certificate as index/primary key into the cert
 database, not taking into account that different certs may have the
 DN, for instance when a CA has both RSA and DSA keys… therefore, many
 HTTPS sites *will* probably fail Konqueror’s validation.

# * new-postinst "configure" [$most_recently_configured_version]
# The package is unpacked; all dependencies are unpacked and, when there
# are no circular dependencies, configured.
#
# * old-postinst "abort-upgrade" $new_version
# * conflictors-postinst "abort-remove" "in-favour" $package
#	$new_version
# * postinst "abort-remove"
# * deconfigureds-postinst "abort-deconfigure" "in-favour"
#	$failed_install_package $fip_version ["removing"
#	$conflicting_package $cp_version]
# The package is unpacked; all dependencies are at least Half-Installed,
# previously been configured, and not removed. In some error situations,
# dependencies may not be even fully unpacked.
#
# * postinst "triggered" "${triggers[*]}"
# For trigger-only calls, i.e. if "configure" is not called.

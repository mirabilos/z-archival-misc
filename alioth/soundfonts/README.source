This repository contains, on branches, packaging
of the debian/ subdirectory for various soundfonts.

Everything else, i.e. the content of the origtgz,
is not included due to sheer size.

Notes to myself:

Repackaged origtgz (from upstreamsâ€™ PKZIP archives)
should be compressed with:

xz --delta=dist=2 --lzma2=preset=9e

Savings:
